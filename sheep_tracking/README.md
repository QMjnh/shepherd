### PI515 Day of Innovation -- Team Norse
Tired of counting sheep? Let us handle that for you! We built an AI model fine tuned for detecting sheep in live camera footage that pairs with our own custom, built from scratch, tracking algorithm. Not only do we track the sheep, but we also calculate the distance each individual sheep has moved over the duration the video. Think of a "Fitbit", but for sheep. Instead of equipping each sheep with their own expensive and annoying monitor, we can leverage AI and preexisting camera systems to devliver a simple and cost-effective software solution to sheep farmers. Like humans, when sheep are feeling ill, they tend not to move much. Therefore, our system can detect the early warning signs of illness and flag those individual sheep at the most risk, saving farmers time and money and keeping our sheep healthy and happy!
